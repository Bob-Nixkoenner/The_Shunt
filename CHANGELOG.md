# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Wi-Fi login pages are detected**: after every network change shuntd checks for a
  captive portal (hotel, train, company guest Wi-Fi). The tray turns yellow, a
  notification comes, and the window asks whether to open the login page in a
  throwaway browser that goes past the tunnels. When you are logged in, the tunnels
  connect by themselves. `shunt status` says so too. Off with
  `[daemon] captive_check = false` (the check asks nmcheck.gnome.org over plain HTTP).
- **Provider .ovpn files import as they are**: DNS scripts and other lines Shunt does not
  run (`script-security`, `up`, `down`, plugins …) are commented out with a note instead
  of refusing the file; Windows-only options (`block-outside-dns`, …) no longer stop
  openvpn on Linux.
- **Installer** checks the connection to GitHub first (20 s) instead of hanging silently;
  with The Shunt active it offers to run itself past the tunnels.
- **Local network past the tunnel** (`allow_lan = true` per tunnel, checkbox in Configure):
  apps in that tunnel still reach printer, NAS and router of the network you are in;
  only directly attached private networks, everything else stays in the tunnel.
- Leak test easier to read (one card per route, long IPv6 resolvers wrap).

## v0.6.0

**OpenVPN, multi-hop, network profiles – and the fixes from the first real-world test.**

### New
- **OpenVPN tunnels** (`driver = "openvpn"`): import a `.ovpn` in the app or with
  `shunt import file.ovpn`; username/password are stored in a 0600 file. Shunt runs
  openvpn itself without scripts; anything in a `.ovpn` that would start programs,
  load plugins, write files or change privileges is refused. Pushed routes are
  ignored, pushed DNS servers are used for that route only.
- **Multi-hop** (`via = "laptop"`): a tunnel's encrypted packets go through another
  tunnel – WireGuard in WireGuard, OpenVPN in WireGuard or the other way round. First
  hop down → second hop blocked, nothing goes direct. Inner MTU set automatically.
- **Network profiles** (`[[network]]`): default route per Wi-Fi name + router MAC,
  e.g. at home direct, everywhere else through the tunnel ("Add the current network").
- **Hotel/train Wi-Fi login**: `shunt captive` / tray item opens a throwaway browser
  that goes direct.
- **Installer**: OpenVPN support, optional privacy on foreign networks (own MAC per
  Wi-Fi, no host name in DHCP, IPv6 privacy addresses).
- **Update check** every 3 hours (can be switched off): notification, tray item and a
  banner with the update command and a copy button.
- **Restart buttons**: tray "Restart service" / "Restart service and app", UI button,
  `shunt restart`.
- `shunt which NAME`: which route each running process takes. The UI warns when an app
  you just routed is still running in its old route (browsers keep their route).
- `shunt import FILE` (with sudo for root-only files like `/etc/wireguard/*.conf`).

### Fixed
- Config editor could overwrite changes made meanwhile (file or other window): saves
  on an old version are refused now, the UI reloads.
- Import/delete/PANIC confirmations could silently do nothing in the desktop window
  (browser dialogs) – replaced by an in-page dialog.
- A DNS server not reachable through its tunnel broke name resolution silently: now
  shown in status, overview and tray (yellow) and as a notification; logged once.
- White text on white select fields with dark GTK themes (Pop!_OS).
- Blank white window in VMs (software rendering).
- Installer: hung on the release lookup (timeouts), could install an older release
  than the current code.
- Orphaned tunnel files no longer block a re-import; clearer permission errors.

### Install / update
```sh
curl -fsSLo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bob-Nixkoenner/The_Shunt/HEAD/install.sh && sudo bash install.sh
```
Afterwards: tray → "Restart service and app".
